#RGBlind

RGBlind is an open-source real-time color blindness simulation tool for the web. It is developed to:
* Help organizations, designers and web developers understand how color blind users might experience their webpages.
* Help designers and web developers understand the problematics with designing for color blind users.

The aim is to help make better structured webpages with high readability, for everyone.

RGBlind is initiated, designed and developed by Interaktiva rum (Interactive rooms), http://www.interaktivarum.se/en, and funded by The Internet Foundation in Sweden, http://www.iis.se/english/.

See example: [simple example](examples/example.html).

RGBlind is available as (1) an extension to the user's web browser, (2) a webpage where the user can input an url for simulation, and (3) an open source toolkit for developers to use in their own web development code.
