#RGBlind

**Project webpage:** http://www.rgblind.se

RGBlind is an open-source real-time color blindness simulation tool for the web. It is developed to:
* Help organizations, designers and web developers understand how color blind users might experience their webpages.
* Help designers and web developers understand the problematics with designing for color blind users.

The aim is to help make better structured webpages with high readability, for everyone.

RGBlind is initiated, designed and developed by [Interaktiva rum (Interactive rooms)](http://www.interaktivarum.se/en) and funded by [The Internet Foundation in Sweden](http://www.iis.se/english).

##Setup and usage
No installation is needed, just clone or download the files and place them in a folder of your choice. The **rgblind** folder contains all the files you need to use the toolkit on your own website:
* rgblind.js
* rgblind.css
* rgblind.svg

Clone with Git:
```
git clone https://github.com/interaktivarum/rgblind.git
```

When including **rgblind.js** on your webpage, the Javascript code injects the required style sheet rules to the document's style sheet.
```html
<script src="rgblind/rgblind.js"></script> <!-- include rgblind.js -->
```

The filters are applied by assigning classes to the DOM elements in the HTML code.
```html
<img src="Ishihara_9.png" class="protanopia"/> <!-- apply protanopia filter to the image element -->
```

Available classes are:
* **.normal** - normal vision, no filter is applied
* **.protanopia** - simulates protanopia, lacking the red cones for long-wavelength sensitive retinal cones, those with this condition are unable to distinguish between colors in the green–yellow–red section of the spectrum.
* **.deuteranopia** - simulates deuteranopia, lacking the green cones for medium-wavelength cones, those affected are again unable to distinguish between colors in the green–yellow–red section of the spectrum.

See [example](examples/example.html) usage.
